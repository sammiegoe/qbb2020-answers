The percent overlap with and without sex as a covariate is: 

Without sex as covariate overlap: 
((# overlapping genes)/(# genes in list without covariate))*100% 
((3648)/(3790))*100% = 96.25% overlap

With sex as covariate: 
((# overlapping genes)/(# genes in list with covariate))*100%
((3648)/(3667))*100% = 99.48% overlap
