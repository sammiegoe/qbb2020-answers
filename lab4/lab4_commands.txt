Lab 4 commands

1. BLAST search - changed settings as follows:
	In algorithm parameters, changed max target sequences to 1000, expect threshold to 0.0001, and optimize for somewhat similar sequences (blastn)
2. Multiple sequence alignment
	Combine query and alignment nt files: cat week4_query.fa blast_output.txt > query_and_blast.fa
	transeq query_and_blast.fa query_and_blast.pep 
		Minimum length 1739
		Maximum length 3694
	MAS with MAFFT: mafft query_and_blast.pep > mafft_output_rerun
